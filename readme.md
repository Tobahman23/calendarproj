## Calendar project

In this project I have managed to create a calendar which displays the current month. The calendars month can be changed by pressing buttons that changes the month. When the month changes so does the picture that is different for every month. The calendar also displays the Swedish namndag(names day) of every date via import of a php file. The main index.php file takes the date and changes the whole display via echo and an if statement.

I definetly could have written things smoother here in my opinion. I think my biggest problem here was that I didn't plan enough since it was my first time using php in a while and so the project didn't end up as well as it could of.
